A user friendly plugin that automatically creates a table of contents. User have to just input which tag he want to create Table of Content.



== Description ==
A user friendly plugin that automatically creates a order list specific index or table of contents which tag or class you want (STOC) for long pages (and custom post types). More than just a table of contents plugin.

the table of contents by default appears where you want on a page via using shortcode. 

This allows the author to insert lead-in content that may summarise or introduce the rest of the page. 

This plugin is a great companion for content rich sites such as content management system oriented configurations. That said, bloggers also have the same benefits when writing long structured articles. 

Discover how Google uses this index to provide 'Jump To' links to your content.

Custom post types are supported, however, auto insertion works only when the_content() has been used by the custom post type.




== Installation ==

The normal plugin install process applies, that is search for `Simple table of Content` from your plugin screen or via the manual method:

1. Upload the `simple-table-of-content` folder into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's it!  The table of contents will appear on pages with at least four or more headings.

You can input plugin shortcode from your post / pages edit windows.

This plugin requires PHP 5.



== Shortcodes ==
The plugin was designed to be as seamless and painfree as possible and did not require you to insert a shortcode for operation.  However, using the shortcode allows you to fully control the position of the table of contents within your page. The shortcode look like below:

= [codeHouse-TOC tag="h5"] =
* simple when you click table of content button from post edit window then automaticaly add above shortcode in your edit page where your cursor live. & you can put tag which tag you want to table of content. You have seperate comma "," if you have multipale tags. 



== Upgrade Notice ==

Update folder with the latest files.  All previous options will be saved.
