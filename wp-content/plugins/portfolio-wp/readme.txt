The portfolio full screen viewers will show thumbnail scroller at bottom side and will show portfolio project images within a slider, where you can navigate back and forth within the same project. This portfolio plugin supports well known Colorbox 5 popup styles too.

If you a little bit know either CSS or JS you will easily customize it. Career Portfolio also supports short-codes, which aims to embed a portfolio on any page by one click.
